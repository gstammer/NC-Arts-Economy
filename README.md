# NC-Arts-Economy
Mapping project for the non-profit group Arts NC

The goal of this project is to aggregate information on the economic impact of the arts in North Carolina & display it via an interactive map. The map was created using R and the Leaflet library, and the end result is an HTML that can be embedded on a website for use by Arts NC.

Geographic and population data is from the NC Office of State Budget and Management.

Economic data is from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.

See the MapInstructions file for further information on the data and how to use and update the map.
